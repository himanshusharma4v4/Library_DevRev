ABSTRACT:
The main objective of Online Library Management System is developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of the library. It has two sides â€“
User side (student / teacher), Admin side.


I have created the library management system which is a website that allows registered users to access library resources. Registered users can log in to their account and see their personal information, search for books, order books, and see the issue and return dates for the books they have borrowed. An automatic timer will show how much time is left until the return date. If a user needs more time to return a book, they can send a message to the admin. There is also a public comment section where registered users can comment on their suggestions and ask questions.

The admin can see which students are online, see all student information, add new books, delete books, send notifications to students before their return dates, and communicate with students through messages. The admin can also reply to comments in the comment box.

There is a page that lists all the students who have borrowed books, along with the return dates for the books.

The web-based library management system is designed to help students and library staff maintain the library in the best way possible and to reduce human efforts.

Here are some specific examples of how the web-based library management system can help students and library staff:

Students can easily search for books and order them online, without having to go to the library in person.
The admin can easily see which students have borrowed books and when they are due to return them. This can help to prevent books from being overdue.
The admin can send notifications to students before their return dates, reminding them to return their books. This can help to ensure that books are returned on time.
The public comment section can be used by students to ask questions about the library or to suggest new books that they would like to see added to the collection. This can help the library to better meet the needs of its users.
Overall, the web-based library management system is a valuable tool that can help students and library staff to maintain the library in the best way possible.
